### Semi-supervised learning based network intrusion detection
Graph-based label spreading, self-training & transductive support vector machine algorithms are used to detect malware attack using popular UNSW-NB15 dataset. After that these three models are compared. Data cleaning, Random Oversampling & Principal Component Analysis are used in the methodology.
